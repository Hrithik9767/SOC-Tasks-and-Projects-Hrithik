# Task 3 – Basic Vulnerability Scan on My PC

## 🎯 Objective
To perform a basic vulnerability scan on my personal machine using a vulnerability scanning tool, identify potential security risks, and understand how such scans are used in real-world cybersecurity operations.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Kali Linux (VM)**
- **OpenVAS / Greenbone Vulnerability Manager (GVM)**

---

## 🧪 Steps Followed

1. **Installed OpenVAS** on Kali Linux.
2. Updated vulnerability feeds to ensure latest database.
3. Configured the scanner and added my PC's local IP as the target (`10.10.1.X`).
4. Launched a **Full and Fast Scan** against the target.
5. Waited for the scan to complete and exported the report.
6. Analyzed the report to understand the critical, high, medium, and low-risk vulnerabilities.
